# Multiclass Classification of Retinal Diseases using Quantum Computing

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on *automated retinal disease classification* using a hybrid *Quantum-Classical Machine Learning approach*.
The system classifies retinal fundus images into *four categories*:

* 👁 Glaucoma
* 👁‍🗨 Normal
* 👁‍🗨 Diabetic Retinopathy
* 👁‍🗨 Cataract

The project leverages *Quantum Computing (PennyLane framework)* integrated with *Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)* to enhance accuracy and explore the potential of quantum-enhanced machine learning in medical imaging.
